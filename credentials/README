# Sealed Secrets Credentials

This folder collects all sealed credentials in order to ease key rotation and forking of the repository. By default, the (un-)sealing keys are not backed up online in anyway, relying on the persistence of the etcd or manual intervention for disaster recovery.

## Forking

If you fork this repo, you will want to either prepopulate the `sealed-secrets-controller` namespace with your sealing keys manually or via means of an external secret store, or bootstrap the cluster once and then retrieve/use the randomly generated sealing-key. After you have established your own keys, use `kubeseal` to seal your own versions of all credentials in this folder.
